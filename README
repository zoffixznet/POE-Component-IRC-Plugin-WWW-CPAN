POE-Component-IRC-Plugin-WWW-CPAN

This module is a L<POE::Component::IRC> plugin which uses
L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin> for its base. It provides interface to
to L<http://search.cpan.org/> from IRC.
It accepts input from public channel events, C</notice> messages as well
as C</msg> (private messages); although that can be configured at will.

The plugin has two "modes" of functionality. First mode
is displaying information about
specified module (this will be the first module found on
L<http://search.cpan.org/> matching the input). The second mode, which
is referred to as B<search command> throughout this documentation will
list the names of modules from L<http://search.cpan.org/> which match
your input. The C<search command> is triggered by starting your
search query with C<'search '> word (which must be separated from
the query itself by white-space).
